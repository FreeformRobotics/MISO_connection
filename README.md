**Welcome!**

This README file briefly introduces the meaning of each python file and some statistical results of experimental data.

**The content is described as follows:**

├── code  <br/>
│   ├── configuration_pointer: An example of how to maintain a library with configuration pointers  <br/>
│   ├── data_generation: The code used to generate the original data in the"/data/Matrix" folder  <br/>
│   ├── enumerate_configuration_space: Method of enumerating configuration space  <br/>
│   ├── example_human: The example in section VI.B of the article  <br/>
│   ├── IM: Pointer_Pairing and CON_Pairing functions and their usage.  <br/>
│   ├── other_algorithms：Other methods not included in the article.   <br/>
│   └── video: video explaining motion planning based on FreeBOT and the sample code  <br/>
├── data  <br/>
│   ├── Matrix1：Empty  <br/>
│   ├── Matrix2：Empty  <br/>
│   ├── Matrix3：Empty  <br/>
│   ├── Matrix4：Empty  <br/>
│   ├── Matrix22：Empty  <br/>
│   ├── Matrix23：Empty  <br/>
│   ├── Matrix24：Empty  <br/>
│   └── results：Intermediate results obtained when the author runs on the local computer  <br/>
├── environment: Python packages that need to be installed  <br/>
├── metadata: Author information  <br/>
└── results: Reproduced results by the Code Ocean platform  <br/>

The size of the original data in the folder "/data/Matrix" is up to 30GB, and we cannot upload it to the capsule. Therefore, the intermediate data in the folder '/data/results' is provided. The code to generate the original data is in ‘/code/data_generation’, and all the codes for generating the intermediate data are also included in the corresponding folder. If interested, it is recommended to download the code to a local computer for reproduction.
